# terraform-plugin-docs

This is a fork of [terraform-plugin-docs](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-docs/) with the following enhancements:

* allow setting the subcategory of a resource by adding a meta attribute to the description. this meta attribute will be removed from the description after parsing
* (planned) link resource pages to their data source page and vice versa
